This is v2.0 of jAADD.

v2.0:
- Multi-threaded LP solving,
- Constructs for modeling control flow: ifS, elseS, endS, assignS,
- Streamlined API for Factories,
- Overloaded Operators for Kotlin
- Adapted API to naming conventions of Java.
- Written in Kotlin, but mostly same API as v1.3 from Java.


v1.3:
Last Java-written release.
API is made compatible with v2.0.
There should be no need to use it, unless one really insists on Java source code.

v1.0:
Initial version, published via maven repository.
